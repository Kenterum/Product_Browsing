# Web Application for Product Browsing

This web application provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for browsing and exploring products. It consists of a main product listing page (`index.html`) and a detailed product information page (`details.html`).

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the application on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you need a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and a basic web server if you wish to serve the files locally.

### Installing

1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Kenterum/WM_Assignment_2.git
     ```
   - If you do not use git, you can download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Open the folder where you cloned or extracted the project.

3. **Open with a Web Server**
   - If you have a local web server, set the project directory as your server's root directory.
   - Alternatively, you can use Python's built-in web server. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run:
     ```bash
     # For Python 3.x
     python -m http.server
     ```
     - Then, access the application at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

4. **Open Directly in Browser**
   - If you do not have a web server, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. However, note that some functionalities that require server-side handling might not work correctly.

## Usage

- **Viewing Products**: Open `index.html` to see the list of products.
- **Exploring Product Details**: Click on any product to view its detailed information on `details.html`.
- **Search and Filter**: Use the search box and filter options on the main page to find products.
- **Navigate Between Pages**: Use the pagination controls to navigate through different pages of products.

## Built With

- HTML - The markup language used for structuring the content.
- CSS - Used for styling the application.
- JavaScript - Used to add interactivity and dynamic functionalities.
